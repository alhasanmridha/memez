# memez

Memes have become a powerful communication tool in the digital age, conveying ideas and emotions quickly and effectively. This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that simplifies meme creation. Users provide a text prompt, and the system intelligently selects a relevant meme template from a curated library. It then generates contextually appropriate text that aligns with both the template and the user‚Äôs input.

Designed for ease of use, the platform eliminates the frustration of searching for templates without knowing their names. By streamlining the process, it enables users to effortlessly create shareable and humorous content. The focus is on intelligent template selection and text generation to ensure high-quality, contextually relevant memes.

# Road Map

## Phase 1: Meme Template Matcher

**Goal:** Create a basic system that can match a user's text prompt to a meme template using a simple AI model trained with predefined data. This will be a very simplified version of template selection, but it will help to get started with code and demonstrate the basic idea to select a meme template.

### Example

**AI Model**  
Our AI model will be trained on example meme data, mapping templates to their common themes:  

```python
meme_templates = {
    "Drake Hotline Bling": "contrasting two choices or preferences",
    "Distracted Boyfriend": "temptation and ignoring the familiar",
    "Success Kid": "celebrating small victories",
    "One Does Not Simply": "expressing difficulty or impossibility",
    "First World Problems": "minor inconveniences of privilege"
}
```  

**User Prompt Example**  
Given the prompt:  
üìù `"learning AI to build a career, learning AI to create memes"`  

### **Expected Output**  
For a similar prompt, such as `"learning programming to understand programming memes"`, the system would select the **"Drake Hotline Bling"** template, as it best fits the contrast in choices.
