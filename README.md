Memes have become a powerful communication tool in the digital age, conveying ideas and emotions quickly and effectively. This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that simplifies meme creation. Users provide a text prompt, and the system intelligently selects a relevant meme template from a curated library. It then generates contextually appropriate text that aligns with both the template and the user’s input.

Designed for ease of use, the platform eliminates the frustration of searching for templates without knowing their names. By streamlining the process, it enables users to effortlessly create shareable and humorous content. The focus is on intelligent template selection and text generation to ensure high-quality, contextually relevant memes.

## Road Map
**Phase 1: Meme Template Matcher**

*   **Goal:** Create a very basic sytem that can match a user's text prompt to a meme template with the help of a simple ai model trained with predefined data.  This will be a *very* simplified version of template selection, but it will get you started with code and demonstrate the basic idea.

  *   **Example:**

        *   **AI model:**  Lets assume our ai model is trained with these example memes data:

            ```python
            meme_templates = {
                "Drake Hotline Bling": "template for showing preference contrasting two options choices",
                "Distracted Boyfriend": "meme about temptation ignoring familiar girlfriend new thing",
                "Success Kid": "meme celebrating victory success small wins",
                "One Does Not Simply": "one does not simply meme template impossible task",
                "First World Problems": "minor inconveniences problems rich people complaining"
            }
            ```

        *   **User Prompt Example:** Let's use your example prompt:  `"learning ai to build a career, learning ai to create memes"`

        *   **Expected Output (Example):**  For the prompt `"learning programming to understand programming meme"`, and the `meme_templates` dictionary above, your script might output: `"Drake Hotline Bling"` (or whichever template has the highest keyword overlap, even if it's not semantically perfect – remember, this is a *very basic* keyword approach for Phase 1).
